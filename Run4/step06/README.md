flat_lambda.cfg acquires just a single flat, possibly useful for step 6.1.

flat_lambda.cfg has a brute force specification of pairs of acquisitions in each combination of
wavelength filter and OD filter, with the acquisitions scaled to give approximately the same
number of electrons/pixel for each OD filter for a given wavelength.

We may want more pairs of each kind - which would be a good application for the new config
file syntax.
