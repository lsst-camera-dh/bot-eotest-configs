flats100_10fluxes_SDSSi.cfg  uses SDSSi filter, repeats 100 sequences of flat pair acquisitions for
    fluxes from 150 to 1500 electrons/pixel [May be too many for one run, given the limitations
    on 2-day store buffer, unless the 2-day store can be purged while running]

flats100_10fluxes_SDSSg.cfg   uses SDSSg filter and fluxes from 1500 to 15000 electrons/pixel but
    otherwise is the same
