flats100_10fluxes_SDSSi.cfg  uses SDSSi filter, repeats 100 sequences of flat pair acquisitions for
    fluxes from 1000 to 100k electrons/pixel [May be too many for one run, given the limitations
    on 2-day store buffer, unless the 2-day store can be purged while running]

flats100_10fluxes_SDSSg.cfg   uses SDSSg filter but otherwise is the same
