flats100_10fluxes_SDSSi.cfg  uses SDSSi filter, repeats 100 sequences of flat pair acquisitions for
    fluxes from 150 to 1500 electrons/pixel [May be too many for one run, given the limitations
    on 2-day store buffer, unless the 2-day store can be purged while running]

flats100_10fluxes_SDSSg.cfg   uses SDSSg filter and fluxes from 150 to 1500 electrons/pixel but
    otherwise is the same

flats100_10fluxes_SDSSr.cfg   uses SDSSr filter and fluxes from 150 to 1500 electrons/pixel but
    otherwise is the same

flats100_2fluxes_SDSSg.cfg    uses SDSSg filter for 150 and 1500 electrons/pixel for 100 pairs
