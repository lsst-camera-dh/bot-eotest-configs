flat_lambda.cfg aquires a flat for each wavelength filter with the ND_OD0.3 filter for the
SDSS broadband filters and no ND filter for the narrowband wavelength filters. Also, aquires
a flat for each ND filter with the SDSSi wavelength filter.

flat_single.cfg acquires just a single flat, possibly useful for step 6.1.
