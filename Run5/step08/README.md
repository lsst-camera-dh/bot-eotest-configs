C_protocol.cfg will need update in [ANALYSIS_RUNS] section to point to Fe55 run number.  Also
for the flat pair acquisition, the number of pairs may need
revisiting.  Initially the pairs are specified as 6 per decade from 450 to 450k electrons/pixel
(for the central raft).  This range should reach full well even for sensors at the edge of the
focal plane.  Flux points are duplicated across changes of ND filter.
